        The current manual attendance system in colleges is problematic due to its time-consuming, error-prone, and manipulable nature, which can delay attendance data availability and lead to inaccuracies. This can adversely affect student performances and evaluations, and the system lacks transparency and accountability. Online attendance systems were developed to overcome these challenges but they also face issues such as technical glitches, privacy concerns, and implementation costs. However, if implemented correctly technology can be a boon for the attendance system and the institution.

RollCall+ application aims to provide an IoT-based attendance system using Blockchain technology that can provide a secure, reliable, and tamper-proof attendance tracking system for educational institutions corporate offices, and other organizations the system can be used to record and track attendance in real-time. It can also provide an immutable record of attendance that can be used for verification and audit purposes. 

The system can be built using IoT devices such as sensors, cameras, and RFID tags. These devices can be used to collect attendance data from the users, the data can then be stored in a secure blockchain database. This database can be accessed by authorized personnel in order to verify and audit the attendance data. 
The system can also be used to provide rewards to employees and students for attendance. The rewards can be in the form of points or tokens that can be used to avail discounts or other benefits. This system can also be used to automate the process of attendance tracking thus eliminating the need for manual intervention.

The aim of RollCall+ is to create an attendance tracking system by utilizing IoT devices in order to automatically capture attendance data, eliminating the need for manual tracking. The working of the model will be as follows:
<p>1.IoT sensors are placed in classrooms or other areas where attendance needs to be tracked.</p>
<p>2.The attendance tracking software integrates the IoT data with blockchain technology ensuring that the data is secure, immutable, and transparent.</p>
<p>3.The attendance data is stored on a decentralized blockchain Ledger, which can be accessed by authorized parties including faculty and administrators.</p>
<p>4.Any changes to the attendance data are recorded on the blockchain creating a permanent record of all attendance transactions.</p>
<p>5.The attendance tracking system can provide real-time attendance data which can be used to improve attendance management commerce student engagement and academic performance.</p>

<p>6.The attendance tracking system can also generate reports, notifications and awards based on attendance data, providing valuable insights to faculty and administrators.</p>
 
<p>
    Overall, an IoT-based attendance system using blockchain technology provides a secure efficient, and effective way to track attendance reduce fraud and improve the educational experiences for students and faculty alike.

The implementation of the model in the organizations will be in the following way:
<p>1. Purchase an NFC sticker for each student.</p>
<p>2. Upload student data to your system. This can be done using a spreadsheet, database, or another method.</p>
<p>3. Write the data on the NFC sticker. You will need a special tool to do this, such as an NFC phone.</p>
<p>4. Attach the NFC sticker to the student’s ID card.</p>
<p>5. When a student needs to access their data, they can simply tap their ID card on a compatible NFC reader. The reader will then read the data from the sticker and display it on the screen.</p>
